Up and Down

You have the default/hello Flutter program, a counter that
counts up.

Add a button to count down.
Add a button to reset the counter to 0.

You may not be able to add these to the 
"floatingActionButton:" space in Scaffold
(because that only holds one).  

You can add them to the Column, which allows all
kinds of Widgets (like FloatingActionButton).
better: add a Row to the Column and make all
3 buttons children of this row.
